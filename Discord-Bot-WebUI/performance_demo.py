Performance Improvement Demonstration

This script demonstrates the performance improvements made to the database
queries and team statistics loading.

Before optimization:
- Each team property (top_scorer, top_assist, avg_goals_per_match) triggered separate queries
- Loading 10 teams = 30+ database queries (N+1 problem)
- Slow page loads, especially on standings and team overview pages

After optimization:
- All team statistics loaded in 3 bulk queries regardless of team count
- Loading 10 teams = 3 database queries total
- 90%+ reduction in database queries
- Much faster page loads

Run this with: python performance_demo.py
