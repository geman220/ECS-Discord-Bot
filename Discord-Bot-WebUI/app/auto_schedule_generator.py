Automatic Schedule Generator Module

This module provides functionality to generate randomized round-robin schedules
for soccer leagues with the following constraints:
- Teams play each other twice during regular season (once each, then repeating)
- Teams play 2 matches per day (back-to-back)
- Supports multiple fields (North, South, etc.)
- Configurable start times and match durations
- Ensures balanced scheduling across weeks
