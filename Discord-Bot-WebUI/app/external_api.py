"""
External API Module for Third-Party Integrations (Modular Version)

This module provides secure, read-only API endpoints designed for external integrations
like ChatGPT Custom GPTs, analytics tools, and other third-party services.

The module has been refactored into smaller, maintainable components:
- external_api/auth.py: Authentication utilities
- external_api/serializers.py: Data serialization utilities  
- external_api/stats_utils.py: Statistics calculation utilities with proper season handling
- external_api/core_endpoints.py: Core CRUD endpoints
- external_api/analytics.py: Advanced analytics endpoints

All endpoints require API key authentication and provide comprehensive data
about players, teams, matches, demographics, statistics, and league information.

## MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN V2.0:

### Fixed Season vs Career Stats Issue:
- get_stats_summary() now correctly returns CURRENT SEASON goals by default
- Uses get_season_goal_leaders() and get_season_assist_leaders() for accurate "this season" data
- Fixed ChatGPT integration issue where "top goal scorer this season" returned career stats

### Modular Architecture:
- Broke up monolithic 3048-line file into focused modules
- Easier maintenance and testing
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved code organization

### Enhanced Season Handling:
- Consistent season filtering across all endpoints
- Proper current season detection and fallback
- Clear distinction between season-specific and career statistics
