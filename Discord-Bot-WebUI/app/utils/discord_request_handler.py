"""
Discord Request Handler Module

This module provides helper functions and classes for making requests to the Discord
bot API with rate limiting, retry logic, and concurrency control. It defines:
  - make_discord_request: an async function to perform a single Discord API request with retries.
  - DiscordRateLimiter: a class to limit the rate of outgoing requests.
  - OptimizedDiscordRequests: a class that uses both a rate limiter and a semaphore to manage
    concurrent requests and cache 404 responses.
  - optimized_discord_request: an async helper to execute multiple Discord requests concurrently.
